# Spotify-Web-Player
- Build and style a Spotify theme music player page using HTML and CSS.

# Overview
- This project is a clone of the Spotify homepage, built using HTML and CSS. 
- The goal was to replicate the look and feel of Spotify's main interface, focusing on key design elements and ensuring responsiveness but it is fully not responsive.
- This project serves as a hands-on exercise to enhance my skills in front-end web development.

# Technologies Used
- HTML5: For structuring the content in a semantic and accessible way.
- CSS3: For styling the components, including the use of Flexbox layout management.

# Learning Outcomes
- HTML & CSS Mastery: Gained a deeper understanding of using HTML5 for semantic structure and CSS3 for advanced styling techniques.
- Attention to Detail: Improved ability to replicate the design and layout of a complex, professional website.
